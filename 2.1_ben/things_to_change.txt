1) elcall set in congradpim for pim models
and hence was set in recipE for rim - but not for pim 

Must have this done seperately for all types 


2) need to call seperations for rim in energy since again done 
as part of polarisation 

Must use the seperate seperation routine at sensible time to suit all
This is required so on;y one set of code and can properly address the 
shite parallelisation

3) One routine for CG min of polarisation for cal of electric field - like energy routine. 


4) Parallelisation
    Recip = Precalculate k-vectors and loop over them evenly. 
    Real = neighbour list - vector of all pairwise interactions within cutoff - loop over with step for number of processes

    OPENMP = possible openMP in addition to MPI
      Recip = difficult - not enought vectors really ?  Perhaps break up whole array terms in chuncks?  
      Real = probably OK to go over interaction pairs in chuncks one for each thread.
