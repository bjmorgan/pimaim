# PIMAIM

##Â Compilation

There is a helper script `compile_pimaim` for compiling the code. This uses `makefile_gww`
This sorts out most of the conditional compilation.
e.g. to compile a dipole version:
```
./compile_pimaim dipole
```
To clean (remove) the dipole version
```
./compile_pimaim dipole clean
```
Object code is stored in a subdirectory so you can have a number of compilations present in the directory at the same time.
